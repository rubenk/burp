2014-04-09: OpenSSL Heartbleed bug
<BR>
It is being widely reported that some recent versions of openssl have a serious
bug. If your computers (especially your servers) are using a version of openssl
between 1.0.1 and 1.0.1f, you should upgrade them to openssl 1.0.1g as soon as
possible. Since this openssl bug has been around for 2 years, you should
probably consider your certificates to be compromised.
<BR>
<BR>
Burp windows clients were using openssl 1.0.1e. I understand that it
is a possibility that a malicious server could steal client information.
<BR>
I have therefore updated the Windows
<a href="/downloads/windows-build-tools/1.3.48/">burp-depkgs</a> with
openssl-1.0.1g and built updated Windows installers for burp-1.3.48
and burp-1.4.12. These installers can be found via the downloads page.

There is still a bug in the Windows strip_vss/split_vss options in burp-1.3.22.
Files that change on Windows are truncated in the backup. If you are using
either of those options, it is recommended that you turn them off until the
next release of burp.
